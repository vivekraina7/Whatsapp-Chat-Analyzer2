## Data Analysis Project: WhatsApp Chat Analyzer and Web Deployment
### Live App : [Whatsapp Chat Analyzer](https://vivekraina7-whatsapp-chat-analyzer2-app-xcfgu8.streamlit.app)

1. Developed a data analysis project to analyze WhatsApp chats and visualize chat data using Python programming language and Streamlit web framework.
2. Preprocessed the chat data, extracted important features like message sender, message text, and time stamp, and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
3. Analyzed the chat data to extract insights such as most active chat participants, popular words, and conversation trends.
4. Visualized the chat data using various charts and graphs like bar charts, word clouds, and line charts to make the insights more accessible.
5. Built a web app using Streamlit to deploy the analysis and enable users to upload their own WhatsApp chat data for analysis.
6. Tested the web app thoroughly to ensure accuracy and functionality.
7. Demonstrated strong skills in data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, and web app deployment.
8. This project can be used as a practical example of how data analysis techniques can be used to extract insights from unstructured data like WhatsApp chats and deployed as web applications.
